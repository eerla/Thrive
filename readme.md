Thrive - Daily Motivational Quotes App
Project Overview

Thrive is a mobile application designed to inspire and motivate users through daily quotes delivered
directly to their devices as push notifications. Upon installing the app, users can personalize their
experience by providing details such as their name, gender, age, occupation, and preferred language.
This information allows the app to generate customized motivational quotes that resonate more deeply
with each user. If specific details are not provided, the app defaults to delivering generic yet uplifting messages.

The quotes are carefully curated to reflect various themes and tones, drawing inspiration from
famous motivational speakers and writers. By utilizing an AI-powered backend service, Thrive ensures
that each notification is fresh and engaging, creating a meaningful daily ritual for users to start their day positively.
